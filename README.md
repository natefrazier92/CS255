Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The owner of DriverPass aims to create a website dedicated to training drivers. The owner believes that students are not receiving adequate driving training, which contributes to the high failure rate among them.
The client, who is the owner of DriverPass, wants a system developed that allows student drivers to sign up for driving course training. They envision a system where users can establish their own accounts and choose the driving packages they prefer.
Users will have the opportunity to participate in online training, complete online exams, and receive practical training on the road as well. The owner will have access to all student and employee accounts.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I worked on the designing requirements of this system well.  The designing requirements are a very critical step to creating this software and it took a lot of precise work

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would focus on both the functional and non-functional requirements because they are a crucial aspect of the project, and as projects
evolve over time, this component is never truly finished. I aim to enhance its stability
so that it doesn't keep changing. I would achieve this by gathering
feedback from students and employers. Input from the clients
who are utilizing the software can be extremely beneficial.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I aimed to thoroughly outline all the requirements that were requested of us.  I wanted to ensure I captured each component (the client, the student, the owner, and the employees) of the requirements separately, which simplified the process.  
The client’s requirements hold significant importance because, without the correct specifications, the project will not serve their needs.  Essentially, without these requirements, we would be unable to finish the project.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When creating the software, my initial step would be to gather the requirements for the new functionalities of the system. After that, I would proceed to design the system and incorporate the new features.
To analyze further, I would seek feedback. Once I received the feedback, I would take into account the system constraints.
From that point, I could focus on implementing any fixes or changes that might enhance the system's performance.
